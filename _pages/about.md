I am a third-year Ph.D candidate in VU Amsterdam. I am in the group of <a href="https://www.vuhpdc.net/people/" target="_blank">HPDC</a>, surpervised by Prof. <a href="https://www.vuhpdc.net/henri-bal/" target="_blank">Prof. Henri Bal</a> and <a href="https://linwang.info/" target="_blank">Prof. Lin Wang</a>.
Before that, I received my Master degree from Tianjin University in 2019, and earned my Bachelor degree from Tianjin University of Technology and Education in 2015.
My resarch is about the batteryless communication. I am trying to build a more sustainable world.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.

<!-- I am an Assistant Professor in the [Embedded Systems Group](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/embedded-systems) of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS) at Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands. I received my Ph.D. from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. Before that, I received my B.Eng. from Nankai University.

I am broadly interested in AIoT (AI+IoT), sensing, mobile computing, and deep learning. My goal is to build deployable AI-powered autonomous cyber-physical systems that are resilient and resource-aware. My research addresses the practical challenges of landing AI on IoT systems including the adversarial examples and privacy attacks, cross-modal learning, domain shift, and computation constraints. -->

<!-- ***I am looking for one Ph.D. and MSc students to conduct system research on resilient and deployable AIoT. Check the job description [here](https://song-qun.github.io/opening/).*** -->

<!-- My research interests also include exploiting physical knowledge to advance the learning process on embedded devices and developing privacy-preserved AIoT systems. -->
