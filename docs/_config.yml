# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

I am a Ph.D. student at VU Amsterdam at HPDC group since Jan 2021, supervised by Prof. Lin Wang. 
Generally, my research focuses on embedded devices and coexisted Cyber-physical systems. 
At present, my research interests are intermittent communication and collaboration within those devices. 
I got my bachelor's with a software engineering certificate from Tianjin University of Technology and Education in 2015. 
I earned my master's degree supervised by Prof. Xiaohong Li at the information security group at Tianjin University in Jan 2019.
After that, I worked at Huawei tech corp as a software engineer for two years.
